Creating a Symbolic Link in Windows
In Windows, symbolic links can be created using the mklink command in the Command Prompt, not PowerShell. Here's how you can recreate the symbolic link:

Delete the Existing Directory or Incorrect Link

First, delete the existing storage directory or incorrect link in the public directory:

Must be first in (path\to\your\laravel\project\public)

powershell
Copy code

Remove-Item -Path .\storage -Recurse

Ensure you're in the public directory of your Laravel project when running this command.

Create a Symbolic Link

Use the mklink command to create the symbolic link. You will need to open Command Prompt with administrative privileges (Run as Administrator) because creating symbolic links usually requires elevated permissions.

cmd
Copy code

mklink /D "F:\xampp\htdocs\test-project\public\storage" "F:\xampp\htdocs\test-project\storage\app\public"

/D: Specifies that you're creating a directory symbolic link.
The first path (F:\xampp\htdocs\test-project\public\storage) is the location where the link will be created.
The second path (F:\xampp\htdocs\test-project\storage\app\public) is the target directory the link points to.
